        <h4>Top Questions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Who is Iro Man?</li>
          <p>
            Iron Man (Tony Stark) is an American comic-book superhero who is a
            mainstay of Marvel Comics. Because of the character’s widespread
            appeal, Iron Man has appeared in multiple comics, television series,
            and films.
          </p>
          <li>Why does Iron have the arc reactor?</li>
          <p>
            The arc reactor keeps Tony Stark alive. In the different versions of
            Iron Man, Stark’s group has been ambushed in Vietnam, the Persian
            Gulf, and Afghanistan. Stark sustained serious injuries as a result.
            He created the personal arc reactor to generate energy for an
            electromagnet keeping shrapnel away from his heart.
          </p>
          <li>What is Iron Man'a suit made of?</li>
          <p>
            In the 2008 Iron Man film, the Iron Man Mark I suit was made of
            reused parts from Jericho missiles. However, the majority of the
            more-advanced suits, starting with Mark III, were made not of iron
            but of a titanium or titanium-gold alloy. In the 2019 film Avengers:
            Endgame, the suit was constructed of vibranium and nanotech.
          </p>
          <li>How does Iron Man die in Endgame?</li>
          <p>
            In the 2019 film Avengers: Endgame, Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.)
            steals the infinity stones from Thanos and transfers them to his own
            suit. When Iron Man snaps, he gets rid of Thanos’s army, but this
            action kills him. In addition to gamma radiation poisoning, the
            energy required to use the gauntlet is too great for him.
          </p>
          <li>When was Iron Man created?</li>
          <p>
            Iron Man first appeared in 1963 in Tales of Suspense no. 39. His
            creation is officially credited to four people: writer and editor
            Stan Lee, who plotted the first story; his brother Larry Lieber, who
            scripted it; artist Don Heck, who drew it; and Jack Kirby, who
            designed Iron Man’s original armoured battle suit.
